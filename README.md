##  Hirschberg Algorithm in C++

This is implemented as in the paper "A Linear Space Algorithm for Computing Maximal Common Subsequences" by
D.S. Hirschberg using the algorithms B and C described there.

1. To build use the Makefile: make
2. Then call ./main
3. Follow the instructions and type, for example, 'hello' or 'longestcommonsubsequence'.
